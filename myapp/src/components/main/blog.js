      Hey guys this is Tejaswi Shah. It’s a great platform that CHESS is providing to guide the upcoming batches of Chemical
      Engineering. First of all let me tell you that Capgemini is an IT company and I got selected in this company through campus
      placement.
 Two rounds were conducted: Online Aptitude Test and Personal Interview. As I was preparing for CAT exams,
so didn't need any extra preparation. However, I highly recommend that you all practice aptitude from online websites like
IndiaBix. There was around 80 questions plus a separate section to solve pseudo codes. Overall level of difficulty is 4/5.
      There was no GD round but still I prepared for it by keeping myself in touch with current affairs and practice speaking in
      front of mirror. In Personal Interview they asked questions mainly from DBMS and OOPS. So, I recommend to study these
      two topics thoroughly. 
            You can take help from YouTube Channels. HR round was mere a formality. They just asked about
            my club activities. I was the President of Enteract-the Official Dramatics club of NIT Durgapur. PI level of difficulty was 3/5.
            You need to be thorough with everything you have written in your CV. Don’t write false content in your CV. That’s all
            about it. Feel free to get in touch with me through my mail. Good luck for your future endeavors.

      Hello everyone this is Jyoti Ranjan Mishra. We are really grateful that CHESS is providing us the platform to guide our
      juniors. I was selected in Capgemini through campus placement. There were two rounds: Online Test and Personal
      Interview. Online test has aptitude section, essay writing section and technical section which includes data structures &amp;
      algorithms and pseudocodes. For aptitude I regularly practiced and revised the things in summer vacation itself from
     books as well as different online sites such as IndiaBix, PrepInsta etc. It&#39;s advisable to focus on verbal aptitude skill,
     probability, permutation-combination etc. Essay writing topic was easy with 160-180 word limit. Avoid spelling and
     grammatical errors and use backspace as minimum as possible. Technical round comprises of mcq questions based on
     data structures &amp; algorithms and pseudocodes.DS and algo questions were mostly theoretical. Give special focus on time
     complexity questions. Overall difficulty is 3/5. There was no GD. The Technical PI lasted for 25-30 minutes. It started with
     basic introduction and all and this is a point you can put your 1st impression as a perfect candidate for the role. Then the
     rest of the questions will move around things you have mentioned in your CV. In my case, I was asked about my summer
     project and then questions from based on my technical skills (C, DS, SQL) in CV. Question level will depend on the
     interviewer and it was moderate in my case. However, it is advisable not to lie/ extrapolate about your skills. Also, if you
     don't know an answer, don't guess blindly. If you are a non CS/IT student, interviewer will focus a lot on the projects you 
     worked, your interest towards learning and coding, your attitude to implement the knowledge for practical purpose. If you
     are in any club or societies, it will be an added advantage.`

      Hi everyone. This is Tanushree Mondal. I am glad that ChESS gave me the opportunity to share my interview experience
with all of you. I was selected in HUL through campus placement. First shortlisting was done on the basis of CGPA and CV.
There were two rounds after shortlisting: Technical PI and HR. Both the rounds were done on Skype.
For PI round I would suggest to go through all departmental subjects thoroughly. On an average they asked 5-7 questions.
Level of difficulty is 4/5.  Mostly they ask questions from your training/intern and from your favorite subjects. In HR round
they asked me why I took chemical engineering, what are my future plans, about my family, whether I am okay with remote
location or not and what is supply chain. As a final tip I would say that answer all questions with confidence and try to
explain in the simplest manner with technical terms when asked., Prepare your favorite subjects properly. They also check
whether you have been in a place for too long or not because their job demands all round India transfer.`,company:"Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL)",batch:"2020",email:"tanushreemondal1998@gmail.com",name:"Tanushree Mondal"}

Hi, this is Kaberi Sarkar. I really appreciate the effort of Chess to help us reach out to our juniors. Firstly, I got selected at
Tata Consulting Engineers through the campus placement process. There were three rounds conducted by the company
namely, pen and paper test, technical interview and HR interview. For the online round, I prepared basics of chemical core
subjects like heat transfer, mass transfer, fluid mechanics mainly and others like CRE, Thermodynamics etc., also a little bit
of formulas, heat exchanger design and analogies., There were 30 technical questions and 30 aptitude questions for the
online round. The level of difficulty for which was 4/5.  The technical questions I faced in PI round were to design Heat
exchanger on paper, tricky questions about pump and valves, basic ideas about distillation column and other mass transfer
phenomenon. I was asked about my internships topics and why I chose design field. For the technical PI round, I prepared
basics of chemical core subjects. Some of the HR questions that I faced in the PI round were to give a solution to a tricky
situation. I was asked about the company little bit,why I wanted to join TCE, why I prefer design field. I was asked to
mention my strengths and weakness, how to handle difficulty and other obstacles in job life etc.The level of difficulty for the
PI round was 4/5. My take away from the interview process was that I had to be confident about my say and attitude
matters. Some tips to juniors to prepare for this particular companies interview is that no need to mug up chemical 
engineering subjects, you should have a clear basic idea about core chemical, go through the basic phenomena of fluid
mechanics, heat exchanger, mass transfer specially. Be confident about what you are saying because they diverts your
ideas to confuse you, always be ready to draw heat exchanger, Valves, graphs, formulas etc, You need to study about the
company, their field, innovation etc. , be confident and try to maintain eye contact with the interviewer and if you can't
remember any topic say that clearly instead of making stories. Good luck.`,company:"TCE",batch:"2020",email:"kaberisarkar.1999@gmail.com",name:"Kaberi Sarkar"}

Hey everyone. This is Aritra Karmakar. It’s a great platform that CHESS is providing to guide the upcoming batches of
Chemical Engineering. I was selected in Tredence from college placement which is a non-core IT company. The placement
process was conducted in three rounds: Aptitude, technical and HR. I practiced aptitude from Indiabix and Pariksha. For
coding I followed geekforgeeks and some youtube videos.There were different sections in aptitude round, guesstimate was
one of them. Overall level of difficulty for apti round is 4/5 . There was no GD round. However it will be wise to be aware
about recent happenings around the world. In the PI round they asked from Sql, guesstimate and puzzles. I practiced
puzzles from geekforgeeks and had an in-depth knowledge of Sql. In the HR round they again asked a few technical
questions but very few. It was just a formality.  PI round was overall 4/5 . I was offered the offer letter there only along with
some goodies.For clearing the initial apti round, you need to practice apti a lot. Questions are easy, but time will be very
less. Practice typing on keyboard. During the online round, 30 mins will be given to you and you will be told to write an
essay and a guesstimate, both of minimum 350 words. So you need to be very fast. Most of my friends were unable to
complete the essay and the guesstimate part. I completed both on time. For the technical round, i would suggest you guys
to have a thorough knowledge of mysql and excel. If you know python and R , it's great. Also study guesstimates from
various youtube videos . Puzzles are also very important. Just go to geekforgeeks and search for puzzles. You just need to
see the first 100 puzzles and you will surely get some common questions during the interview. And for the Hr round, I would
suggest you be confident about what you speak that will do the job.`,company:"Tredence",batch:"2020",email:"aritra240@gmail.com",name:"Aritra Karmakar"},

First of all I would like to thank CheSS for proving me the opportunity to help my juniors. I was selected in Aditya Birla Group
from campus placement. The placement process was held in 4 rounds: Online Test, GD, Technical Interview and HR
Interview.Below are the sites I had followed while preparing for aptitude in order of difficulty:
1. Indiabix
2.A to Z exams
3.Pariksha
4.Lofoya
5. FACEPREP
For the technical part just go through some of the reference books for respective subjects.
In 120 minutes we have to solve 40 aptitude questions and 60 technical questions. Overall level of difficulty is 3/5. In the GD
round a Case study was given where we had to analyze among five unique startups which was the most feasible and
profitable one. Be vigilant about current topics and practice how to summarize your points. In the PI round they asked
mainly from the industrial training I had undergone, heat exchangers, cooling towers and basic questions from fluid
mechanics. In the HR round they asked questions from my CV and justification of what I have mentioned in it. Difficulty of
the HR round was 3/5.Remember some of the key points:
1. Never miss proposing a tagline or a catchy phrase at the end in GD.
2. Technical questions were completely based on the practical application of what you have learnt in 4 years.
3. HR round is how well you can portray yourself as the right person for them.
Last but not the least I would like to add few more points:
1. Be very competent in the Online test. Work on your speed in doing minor calculations.
2. Improve your vocabulary
3. Try to initiate the talk in GD and listen patiently to what others are saying.
4. If you don’t know any answer just admit it. Don’t be oversmart.`,company:"Aditya Birla Group",batch:"2020",email:"j.nisharao@gmail.com",name:"J Anisha Rao"},

Hi, this is Bidipta. I got selected in RIL through the campus placement procedure. Thank you, ChESS for
giving me an opportunity to share my experience. The different rounds conducted by the company were:
· Online(Aptitude + Technical)
· Interview (Technical + HR)
I did not take any such preparation for the online aptitude round.Approximately, 50 questions were asked
in the online round, the level of difficulty for which was ⅗. The technical questions I faced in PI round were
asked from:
· transport phenomena (fluid mechanics, especially pumps and valves)
· control and instrumentation(close loop control system)
· project work(recent and summer intern)
· some questions from elective subject.

For the technical PI round, I made sure that every line I have written in my CV is crystal clear to me and I can
answer each of them and I went through the important chem engg subjects which were taught in previous
semesters.The HR questions I faced in the PI round were:
1. Tell me about yourself
2. Extracurricular activities
3. Why should we select you over others?
4. Weakness
5. What will you do if your subordinates don't abide by your instructions?
The level of difficulty for the interview process was ⅘. My takeaway from the interview process was that the
questions (both online and technical PI) were the very basics of chemical engineering and you can easily answer
them if you remember the things which were taught in the previous semesters. Try to be a bit smart while
answering the HR questions but don't lie to them as they are much experienced than you.
Some tips to my juniors to prepare for this particular companies interview will be:
1.Questions are asked in such a way that if you have the basic knowledge regarding the subject, you can easily
answer them.
2. If you don't know the exact answer, try to approach the question in a logical manner.
3. Don't write anything in your CV which you are not well aware of.

Hi, this is Ananya. Thank you for asking me to share my experience. I got selected in Linde by the campus
recruitment process. There were three different rounds conducted by the company namely, Pen and Paper Test
(includes technical, aptitude and english), PI (technical and HR). For the pen and paper test, I checked in
glassdoor.com that what kind of questions they generally ask, and then I prepare accordingly. There were
around 50 questions for the pen and paper round, the level of difficulty for which was 4/5. Generally Linde
takes GD but in our time due to less number of students who qualified the pen and paper test, GD didn&#39;t
happen. Linde's GD topics are mostly on trending and common issues.
Technical Questions in the PI round, started from my favourite subject then interviewer tried to link it with
Thermodynamics and then some basic questions from Physics and Chemistry. Mostly, basics questions were
asked in the PI round. For the technical round I mostly focused on the unit operations and different types of
equipment, their working principles and most importantly thermodynamic processes and cycles. In the HR
round, normal HR questions like Tell about yourself (background + education + hobbies), passion in life,
aspirations, where you see yourself after 5 years, which domain you would like to work in Linde
(process/sales), any location problem, interested in doing MBA or not and why (never say NO, try to give
diplomatic answer) etc. were asked. The level of difficulty for the PI round was 4/5. My take away from the
interview process was:
1. Be confident and maintain eye contact with a gentle smile
2. Give positive responses to every question, don't say direct NO to any question. Try to be little diplomatic.
3. Focus on your forte.
Some tips to juniors to prepare for this particular company&#39;s interview are:
1. Focus on the pure basics of chemical engineering.
2. Prepare Thermodynamics thoroughly
3. Study about every equipment (including compressor), it&#39;s working principles.

Hi, this is Monalisa Gorain. I got selected in Reliance Industries Limited by the campus placement procedure.
I practiced aptitude questions from pariksha and brushed up the important concepts and formula of fluid
mechanics, mass transfer, heat transfer, cre and process control before the test. Many of the previous year gate
questions are repeated, so if you are a gate aspirant and preparing for it, it will definitely provide you an upper
hand. Time will be short, so make sure you don't waste a lot of time on a problem. There were 30 aptitude
questions and 50 technical questions in the online round, the level of difficulty for which was 3/5. Reliance
came for recruitment for 2 different positions for our batch- for RPMG and for Operations. So the very first
question t. 3 rounds were conducted by the company. First one was the online (technical+aptitude) round,
second was the technical interview round and finally the HR round. I think the online round was the most
crucial round. Around 45 students sat for the online test and only 10 were shortlisted hat I was asked in my PI
round was why I wanted to go for operations and not RPMG. I was cross questioned on answering that. Then
they asked me some basic questions of fluid mechanics related to bernoulli’s theorem and pumps (cavitation,
types and utilities). They were not exactly direct questions rather application based so make sure you have
crystal clear concepts of your core subjects. I had done my 3rd year summer training at IOCL Haldia, so next
part of the interview was completely based on that. I was asked questions about various units of the refinery
(functions, products, inlet stream source, outlet stream destination). Most of the questions were based on
sulphur removal from crude petroleum. Then I was asked, if electric cars completely take over the market,
what would happen to reliance. And then finally the technical interview ended with some HR questions. For
the technical PI round, I made sure to have my basics clear of my core subjects(heat transfer, mass transfers,
cre, fluid mechanics and process control). I asked my seniors about the interview process, they told me that
small problems could be asked to solve, so I went through the important formulas. I read about my projects
and trainings before interview. The first question in the HR round was the same as the technical interview
round i.e why I went for operations and not RPMG. Second, was why I wanted to join reliance. Then they
asked me to name five companies from the Fortune 500 list. Then they asked about my takeaways from IOCL
Haldia. Then some questions about club and stuff. Then they finally asked me, what if they paid me 4 lakhs
and gave a chance to work in their refinery. The level of difficulty in the PI round was also 3/5. I think with
every interview I improved. I learned to represent myself with confidence. I retrospect on what went wrong
and work towards improving that. Besides I got to know alot about Reliance Industries and the various perks
of working at Reliance. Some tips to juniors to prepare for this particular company&#39;s interview are that try to
do training in some refinery or petrochemical industry. That&#39;s the job you will have to do at Reliance being a

chemical engineer, so prior experience will obviously provide you advantage both in the interview and your
job. Besides you will get exposed to almost every unit operation you have studied. All the best.

GD round and my topic was “Is India ready for digital economy”. Nothing much as a preparation for GD, just
need to be aware of current issues going around oneself. In technical PI round , Mostly questions about my,
internship and some from my projects and academics.My preparation for the Technical round was that I cleared
all my doubts about my projects and internships. In HR round, I faced Mostly questions about why did I want to
join the company, why that job role,why that location and job sector. Takeway from the interview - “If I don't
know about anything I must be confident enough to say a &#39;no&#39; rather than pretend.”. Tips to my juniors - They
want mostly active learners because none of us freshers can know much about medicines or analytics.`,company:"Novartis Healthcare Private Limited",batch:"2020",email:"disha.dhar98@gmail.com",name:"Disha Dhar"},

Selection rounds were : Technical, GD, PI. First round was It was offline and 30 questions were asked. No
preparation for first round. My GD topic was “Environmental concerns”. No preparation for GD. Technical
questions I faced are : Numerical to calculate economy and steam consumption and heat load in evaporator, Write
the analogies (Reynold, Prandtl, Coulborn), What happens to head and flow rate if pumps are in series and
parallel?, Define NPSH,cavitation, Type of pumps, Questions related to training. HR Questions I faced : Why not
Mtech?, Can u relocate? So you are from east and would ge going to west so can You do job? Will Your parents
allow you?, What makes you angry?, where do you like to see yourself after 5 years?, Define management. My
takeaway from interview : Interviews became monotonous for me as I was getting same type of HR questions till
being placed. Tips to juniors : Do a academic project.`,company:"PI Industries",batch:"2020",email:"sayangoswami1972@gmail.com",name:"Sayan Goswami"},

Aptitude round preparation can be done from the websites like IndiaBix. There were 30-aptitude,50-technical
mcq. There is no GD round in RIL But still we can prepare GD by discussing about the current affairs between
friends and also practising it individually.
Fortunately or unfortunately I got RPMG panel of RIL. They ask numerous technical questions focusing mainly,
on distillation from mass transfer and Pumps in fluid mechanics and heat exchangers in heat transfer. They
mainly focus on the different extreme conditions of the topic. For example: They ask questions on blowdown and
floding conditions on distillation, NPSH calculations of pumps, Different types of trays and their advantages and
disadvantages in distillation column etc. They also ask questions to test our presence of mind and our
applicational abilities. For example There is a pool of water and we need to evaporate it what are the methods we
suggest ( we can consider any assumption we want). These are few questions they asked me.

My Preparation for Technical round : Follow the class notes even if it is basic it will be easy to answer questions
spontaneously. Deep study on the topics -Distillation,Heat exchangers, pumps is necessary. I done it from online
NPTEl lectures and followed DS sir notes( a professor in Calcutta university, he offers gate coaching).
HR round is just for name sake. They asked basic questions like tell me about yourself etc. but prepare for this
question perfectly. A form will be provided by RIL which should be filled before PI. Fill the CV and form in such
a way so that they can’t point out any point In your form. Don’t write any false statements in form.
Takeaway from interview : It’s not too difficult or not too easy but we have to be patient and doesn’t loose our
control of mind and hope in interview.
Tips to juniors : Above all can be followed only when you clear apti round. So practise aptitude everyday it has
more weightage than technical round. So concentrate on it. Be patient and calm during interview and use paper
and pen more in the interview it helps more.(paper and pen will be provided in interview ).

Hey guys, this is Ritika Das. I am really elated that CHeSS is providing us a platform to share our personal 
campus placement experiences and I am definite that the upcoming batches will find it useful when they face their placements.
 So, I got selected in Saint-Gobain India Pvt Ltd through the on-campus recruitment process. The selection procedure consists of 4 rounds with each 
 being an eliminative one:
 1)Aptitude cum Technical online test-it consisted of 4 sections- non verbal reasoning, verbal reasoning, numerical ability, technical
  section. The level of difficulty was moderate and the technical section was not only limited to your branch subjects but also had 
  question from basic sciences. For this round platforms such as Indiabix, Pariksha can be useful and for the technical part class notes would be more than sufficient.
  2) Group Discussion: The GD was based on a case study. A problem statement was given to the group and each of the candidate was given some 
  clues using which they had to mutually come to a solution to the problem statement.
  3)PI round: Both Technical and HR questions were asked during this round.
   Questions from your internships and branch related subjects were asked. The main focus was on the subject of fluid mechanics and heat transfer. The level of difficulty of the questions were moderate and having a basic understanding of the subjects will be enough to get you through. I personally followed only my class notes on these subjects.
   I would suggest prepare fluid mechanics, Heat transfer, Process control thoroughly. Be prepared with whatever information you are providing on your CV because they will always refer to it and ask from all those points. For HR part the basic questions such as- what are your career goals , why would you choose saint-gobain, and questions regarding your extra-curricular and college activities were  asked.
   4)MD round- This round was held in the Chennai head office with the MD of the company. Technical as well as non technical questions were asked. For technical parts questions from Fluid mechanics were asked and basic equations like the navier stoke, Bernoulli's theorem was asked to derive. I would suggest be thoroughly prepared with basic derivations from fluid mechanics and transport theorem and also brush up on your mathematics. For non technical part questions can be asked from any domain and you might be asked to do anything even push-ups (yes you read that right).
   I was asked questions from political scenarios in West Bengal and was asked my opinion on it which I had to justify.
This company has a very unique recruitment process than the rest of the organisations. The key factor here is to have a sound knowledge of the subjects, being thorough with your CV and having confidence. Confidence is a very important factor because the GD, PI round will be pool campusing where  you will be up against students of even other NIT's and the interview rounds can last up to more than an hour (it was 1hr 20 min for me).Even for the MD round you have to travel all the way up to Chennai
  (accommodations and travel fare will be provided by them) which can be tiring, but you have to stay calm and composed. So you have to have the nerves , be patient and prove yourself worthy. Another piece of advice is that do not try to bluff the panellists, if you can't answer then just surrender.
I hope my experience will be of help to you all. Tick all the checkboxes and rest is on luck. All The Best!!
